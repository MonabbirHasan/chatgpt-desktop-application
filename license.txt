A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. Chatbots are used in a wide variety of applications, including customer service, information gathering, and entertainment. They can be used to provide automated customer support, answer questions, and provide information on products and services. Chatbots can also be used to facilitate online shopping experiences by providing product recommendations and helping customers find the best deals. Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as they become more sophisticated and are able to understand natural language processing (NLP).

Chatbots use artificial intelligence (AI) to understand user input and respond accordingly. AI-powered chatbots can understand complex queries and provide accurate answers in real-time. They can also learn from past conversations to improve their responses in the future. Additionally, chatbots can be programmed with specific rules or scripts that allow them to respond in predetermined ways when certain keywords or phrases are used.

Chatbots have become increasingly popular due to their ability to provide quick responses and automate mundane tasks such as customer service inquiries or product recommendations. They are also being used in a variety of industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, travel, hospitality, education, and more. As AI technology continues to evolve, chatbot capabilities will continue to expand as well.
